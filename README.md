**Kyouka** is a web application build with **FastAPI** and **Vue.js** used to control Windows Media Keys remotely using your smartphone or any browser.

> ðŸ’¡ Currently tested only on Windows 10 machine, but should work on Linux too!

It allows you to control YouTube music playing *(Or any other player!)* from your desktop while in bed and away from the keyboard.  
How awesome is that!

**Kyouka** is a single Python process running on your desktop that simulates keyboard media button presses and provides you with a web interface that can be accessed in your local network.

## ðŸ”¥ Getting Started

**It's easy to get started using Kyouka!**

- Install all required dependencies by running this command against the provided `requirements.txt` file.

  ```bash
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Run `kyouka.py` file by clicking on It or if it doesn't work type:
